What is the difference between the source and sh commands?

-> Source - The source command reads and executs commands from the file specified as its argument in the current shell. It does not create a new process, any changes made by the scripts persist in the current shell sessions.
- We execute the process in our current terminal.
- Since the program will be executed in current terminal we don't nedd to give it execution permission.

-> sh - The sh command starts a new subshell and executes the script in this new shell. The subshell is a separate process from the current shell, any changes made by the script are confined to the subshell and so not effect the parent shell.
- A new process is created because shell makes an exact copy of itself, this child process has the same environment as its parent. Only the process ID no is different. this process is called forking.

-> diff a.txt b.txt              // compare the contents of two files and display the difference between them
-> cmp a.txt b.txt               // compare the two files bytes by bytes




What is the difference between ls and lsof?

You have some process running on a port in your system. How can you view and then kill the process from the terminal?

Now to kill a process we have to look for the process id (PID)

- Kill the process
sudo kill PID
